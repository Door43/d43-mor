**Jesus** taught that some people will **receive** him and be **saved**, but **others will not**. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the **good news** of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the **seed of God's word** does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into **his kingdom**.
