So **Pharaoh** and his army chased after the **Israelites** to **make them their slaves again**. When the Israelites saw the **Egyptian** army coming, they realized **they were trapped between Pharaoh's army and the Red Sea**. They were very afraid and cried out, “**Why did we leave Egypt**? We are going to die!”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **they were trapped between…Red Sea** - Another way to say this would be, "there was nowhere they could go to escape since the Egyptians were behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them."
  * **Why did we leave Egypt?** – This means, "We should not have left Egypt!" They were not really asking for reasons. Because they were afraid, in this moment they were wishing they had not left Egypt (even though it had been very difficult for them there).
